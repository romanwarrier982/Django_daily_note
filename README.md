This is a comprehensive task for developing a note-taking application with integrated audio recording. Below is a high-level plan on how to approach this project, including technical design choices, outline of features, and implementation steps.

### Project Structure
- **Backend (Django REST Framework):**
  - Django for the web framework
  - PostgreSQL as the database
  - Django Rest Framework for building APIs
  - JWT for authentication
  
- **Frontend (ReactJS):**
  - Create React App for bootstrapping the frontend
  - Axios for making API requests
  - React Hooks for managing component state
  - Optional: Use Material-UI for UI components

### Proposed Technical Design and Architecture

#### 1. User Authentication
- Create User model using Djangoâ€™s built-in User model.
- Implement JWT authentication using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`.
- Endpoints will include:
  - `POST /api/register/` for user registration
  - `POST /api/login/` for user login
  - Protected routes for note management.

#### 2. Daily Notes Management
- Create a Note model with fields for title, description, and a ForeignKey to the User.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations:
  - `GET /api/notes/` to list all notes for a logged-in user
  - `POST /api/notes/` to create a new note
  - `GET /api/notes/<id>/` to view a specific note
  - `PUT /api/notes/<id>/` to update a note
  - `DELETE /api/notes/<id>/` to delete a note

#### 3. Audio Recording
- Use the Web Audio API or a library like `react-mic` for audio recording on the frontend.
- Endpoint to handle the audio file upload (as a Base64 string or binary).
- **Audio Model:** Create an Audio model with fields for the recorded file and a ForeignKey reference to the Note it belongs to.

#### 4. Testing
- Use Django Test Framework to test API endpoints and functionality.
- Use Jest and React Testing Library to write tests for the frontend components and actions.

#### 5. Dockerization
- Create Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend.
- Use docker-compose to set up services for the application, including the database.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pyindent/daily-note-django-react.git

   cd django_react_auth_system
   ```

2. Install Python packages. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

   ```sh
   (windows)
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   (linux)
   virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate # Create a virtual environment and activate it

   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in backend directory and add the variables as shown in the .env-example file. You will need to add your own values for the variables. You can optionally export the variables as environment variables to your terminal.

4. Create a PostgreSQL database and add the database credentials to the `.env` file or export them as environment variables to your terminal.

5. Run the migrations

   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Run the backend server

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   This will run the backend server on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

8. (Optional) Run the frontend server. You can skip this step if you don't want to run the frontend separately as the frontend is already built and being served by the backend.

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm install react-mic --force
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the frontend server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
